                    </h3>
                    <p>Not analysing the needs & demands of target customers is yet another reason why 42% startups fail to succeed. Remember, you need enough customers to buy your products or service, for your business to succeed. And that’s why it makes sense to evaluate your potential customer base before launching your new business.


                    </p>
                    <p>You’ll need to present yourself attractive option to lure customers to your business. The best way to understand the needs and demands of your potential customers is to put yourself in their shoes and look at your products and services with their point of view.


                    </p>
                    <p>Then tailor your products, services and your marketing efforts to those customers. There are manifold rewards of understanding your customers: you get to strengthen the brand loyalty and trigger positive word-of-mouth recommendation for your products and services.

                </h3>
                <p>A basic ingredient to run an online business is to have a well-designed website. You need to put everything regarding your business in your web pages. People will come across your business through your website. When they will visit your website, it should make a good first impression on them. This means that each color, font, image, symbols, text, etc, elements you pick to create your website should impress the visitors.




                </p>
                <P>Your website must hold all the information that your target customers want. It must have pages such as About Us that tells all about what your company and business does. Tell how your business stands out in your niche market. There should be details about the products or services you sell.

                </P>
                <P>Also, mention the specific solutions that your business provides to the customers. Makes sure that your website has other pages like Contact Us that has your company’s physical address or any other address.

                </P>
                <p>Pages such as Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy, etc. must also be there as part of your website.But most importantly, your website design should stand out in its use of design concept, colors, typeface and various other elements.

                    </h3>
                   <p>If you take a good look at the logos of the online business startups, you will find that their logos are mostly nothing more than a casual drawing. Remember that a logo is not just a symbolic representation of a company in a market. It is, in fact, a tool to engage your potential customers with your business. A uniquely designed logo draws people’s attention quickly, which becomes the starting point for engaging them with a business.




                </p>
                <p>The fact is that a memorable logo design can help you build a brand identity. If people like the logo, they will keep it in memory. Whenever they see the logo, it will immediately remind them of your business.

                        </h3>
                       <p>Another reason for the failure of many online business startups is that they simply ignore the power of social channels in promoting a business. In the modern world, people use social channels to get updated information. They communicate with the world using a variety of these channels including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Google+, and many others.





                    
                   </p>
                   <p>Your potential customers of startup are mostly present on different social media. Make sure that your business has a dedicated social media page on most of these channels. Then, post content regarding your company, business, products or services regularly. The content should be such that they can interact with your business.

                                <p>Besides inadequate understanding of customer preferences, 29% startups often struggle to keep their finances uptight. Addressing this issue is perhaps the first step in helping startups achieve success. Unfortunately, even the most promising of entrepreneurs fail to set up a stable flow of cash.

                            <p>In order to succeed, startups must try to keep their costs low and try to ensure a smooth inflow and outflow of the company cash. It makes sense to utilize the vast ocean of free and easily available resources to keep the operating costs low.

An article published at Entrepreneur.com reveals that forming the right team is perhaps the first critical step to building a sustainable company. No matter you’ve spent through your nose for a creative logo design, a fancy website and an extra-luxe office space, nothing can save your startup company from falling flat if you don’t have a great team.
