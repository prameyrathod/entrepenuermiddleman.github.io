                    <h3> 01. Tell your business story</h3>
                    <p>Try to make your story as interesting as possible while talking less about your company and more about your customers. However, certainly this is not the way to go about! Take a look at the following brand storytelling and learn its shortcomings.<br>
                        Do you know that story telling that was once associated with kids has now grown up as an effective marketing tool? That means both the purpose and scenario of story telling have drastically gone beyond their traditional boundaries.The purpose of telling your business story to people and more specifically to your targeted customers is to ensure their positive participation in your business and company activities. More emotional and physical participation means more mouth-of-word publicity of your business and more customer traffic on your online site.<br>
                        
                    </p>
                       
                      However, story telling does not mean that you go on talking only about your business endeavors. Instead, it requires you to talk more about your consumers. It’s like this –<br>
                        No one likes a person who talks only about himself, the same thing goes for your brand as well
                        . So, your company should not be indulging itself in chest-thumping all the time talking only about its achievements. Rather, going ahead and telling the world the stories your consumers share with you is a much better brand building strategy. In addition, your brand positioning statement should also be unique.<br>
                        
                        Locate the stories that your consumers want to hear. Tell such stories to reinforce your overall brand value so that people can easily relate with your business emotionally.
