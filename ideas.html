                        </h2>
                    <p>Food being one of the three basic necessities of life makes a top choice for people to indulge and open-up business in F&B (Food and Beverage) Industry. This is why as a small scale business idea, food joints will never run out of customers, as long they serve delectable food. Of course a start-up business does not need to be a full-fledged restaurant from the start. One can start with only a few key dishes such as a wholesome traditional breakfast with optional snacks as an add-on.

This is why the humble juice bar has made into this small business ideas list for India as a top option for a potentially successful venture. While one is at it, diversification into related drinks especially (perhaps less healthy) summer drinks like lemonade, buttermilk and lassi might also work out well for this small business. Of course one can decide to go the whole hog and get started with a fully loaded food truck instead. As long as the food/drinks provided are of high quality and all the requisite permits are in order, ensuring success of this business idea should not be too hard.
