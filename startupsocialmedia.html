                    </h3>
                    <p>Choosing the right platform seems simple- why can’t you just be on all of them, right- but this is an essential step to ensuring you reach the customers that are interested in your products and willing to buy even if they don’t recognize your name or brand identity, so start here.

                    </p>
                    <p>Every social media platform that’s successful today has started with a mission. For some, like Facebook, it’s as simple as connecting people to one another and their interests, but when you stretch into the realm of LinkedIn and Myspace, you start to see a focus. LinkedIn is, of course, for business to business connections and Myspace, a reincarnation of a very different site by the same name, is now all about music and celebrities.

                    </p>
                    <p>When you go to choose a platform, take into consideration what products or services you intend to offer and what kind of personality you want your business to portray. If you’re looking for sophistication, LinkedIn might work for you, but if you’re looking for a party feel, Myspace may be more up your alley.

                    </h3>
                   <p>Once you’ve chosen a platform, finalized a design and began to garner interest in your products and services through valuable content, don’t forget to listen to the feedback people will undoubtedly be sharing about their experiences. Kissmetrics.com reveals that consumers like to feel heard and made to feel as though someone cares about their experience. Remember that a negative experience with a company, even if your products or services are otherwise fine and met the customer’s’ needs, could cause them to look elsewhere. There’s always another company willing to cater just a little more than you did and customers will always be on the lookout for that next good thing.

                       <p>Social media makes it easy to create and nurture both small and large communities around your business and empowers your customers to share their thoughts, feedback, ideas and help one another troubleshoot without you having to be directly involved 100 percent of the time.

                                <p></p>Less well-known and less often used is the fact that many social media platforms offer customizable ways to market and sell products right from within their domain. With customized domains, email addresses, marketplaces and shopping carts readily available to every web developer, no matter how novice they might be, it could seem obsolete to use a social media site to this end but there is a lot of value in not only displaying your product via advertisements, but offering them directly for sale with just a few clicks.
